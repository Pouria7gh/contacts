A windows forms application that works similar to your contact app on your phone exept it uses a database to store numbers and users(admin or normal user).
i used sql server and EF to store numbers and users.
If you want to check it out make sure you modify the conection strin in "Contacts\Contacts.DataLayer\Model\MyDbContext.cs" directory so you can run it using your own local sql server.
This App is written in my native language.
